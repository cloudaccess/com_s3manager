This is a Joomla! 1.5 component that allows you to manage media placed on Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), and use it on your webpage. It used to be a commercial component by http://cloudaccess.net/ but now is open sourced as a gift to Joomla! community.

Media management features:
* Create and delete buckets
* Upload and delete files to buckets
* Transparently use S3-hosted files in your articles
* Links presented in the frontend have only limited lifespan, that you can configure.
